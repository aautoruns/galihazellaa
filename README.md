## Getting Started 🚀

If you want to copy my portfolio, please follow these steps. These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

<p>
From your command line, first clone this repo:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/aautoruns/portfolio

# Move into the repository
$ cd portfolio

# Remove the current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin
```

Then in your text editor click `Run` to see the portfolio locally. It should look like the below screenshot.

Once you finish your setup. You need to put your website online!

I highly recommend to use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) because it is super easy.
